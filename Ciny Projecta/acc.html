    <section>
    <p>There are a limited number of hostels in Armenia, and most of them are in the capital, Yerevan. Hostels start at 3,343 AMD ($7 USD) per night for a bed in a dorm, but average around 3,169 AMD ($10 USD) per night. These prices are pretty consistent around the country, no matter how many beds are in the dorm.

    <p>A private single or double room is around 11,938 AMD ($25 USD) with a shared bathroom, but outside the capital city, you can find private rooms for as low as 8,118 AMD ($17 USD).
      </p>  
    <p>Free wifi is standard, though kitchens and free breakfast arenâ€™t very common.
      </p> 
    <p> Two-star budget hotels average around 9,550 AMD ($20 USD) per night for a double or twin. Airbnb is another great budget option in Armenia, with shared accommodation (like hostel dorms) starting at 3,169 AMD ($10 USD) per night. A private room averages about 14,325 AMD ($30 USD) per night, while you can expect to pay about 26,264 AMD ($55 USD) per night for a full apartment or home.
      </p>   
    <p>For anyone traveling with a tent, camping is available around the country. For those not traveling with a tent, you can often rent them at the Tourist Information Centers. Wild camping is free, but if you prefer camping on a campsite prices start at around 4,000 AMD ($8 USD) per night for two people and a tent.</p>
