<p>1. Take the cable car to Tatev</p>
<p>Noravank may hold the title for the most beautiful monastery in Armenia, but it’s Tatev monastery that holds the prize for the most terrifying. This medieval monastery was built between the 9th-13th centuries and is unique thanks to its position on the edge of a deep gorge. The only way to visit the monastery is by taking the cable car across a 5,752-meter ropeway (the longest in the world) suspended 320 meters above the River Vorotan. The cable car ride will take you around 15 minutes, and admission is 7,000 AMD ($15 USD).
</p>
<p>2. Visit Shikahogh State Reserve</p>
<p>State Reserve is the second largest forest in Armenia and is home to some diverse wildlife including leopards, bears, wild goats, and vipers. There are some lush mountain hiking trails here (although they are not always well maintained) that will lead you to Iron Age tombs, medieval churches and monasteries, waterfalls, crystal-clear springs, and even abandoned towns. The seven-mile (11-kilometer) route from the Mount Khustup to Shishkert village is a tough but incredibly scenic route.
</p>
<p>3. Swim in Lake Sevan</p>
<p>known as the “Armenian Sea,” Lake Sevan is located high in the Caucasus mountains and is the perfect place to cool off mid-hike. The lake is so high that if you sit on the river bank, it almost looks like the river is running into the sky. You can wild camp here as well for free.
</p>
<p>4. See Geghard Monastery</p>

<p>From the rock face of the Azat River Gorge, Geghard Monastery is a World Heritage-listed building named from the lance that pierced Christ’s side at the crucifixion. Inside the Avazan Chapel is a sacred spring that runs through the monastery where people fill up bottles to take the holy water home.
</p>
<p>5. Visit the Echmiadzin Cathedral</p>

<p>Only 12 miles (20 kilometers) from Yerevan, no visit to Armenia would be complete without seeing the city of Echmiadzin. The most famous site in Echmiadzin is its cathedral. The cathedral was built to commemorate the fact, in 301 AD, Armenia was the first country in the world to adopt Christianity. The cathedral’s museum has some fascinating artifacts, including a piece of the cross on which Jesus was crucified, the spear that pierced his side, and even a supposed piece of Noah’s Ark. Admission to the museum is 1,500 AMD ($3.15 USD).
